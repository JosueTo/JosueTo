## Welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹

A few thing about me:  
I am a backend developer from Durango, MÃ©xico and currently living and working in CuliacÃ¡n, MÃ©xico.  
I jumped from being an Industrial Engineer to become a full time Backend Developer and I have interest in learning the Cloud and DevOps.  
  
Among being a Backend Developer I'm also pursuing a bachelor degree in Computer Systems Engineering at [Virtual University of the State of Guanajuato](https://uveg.edu.mx/index.php/es/).  
I am passionate about my career and I would like to collaborate to build the tools that will have a significant impact in the coming times.
